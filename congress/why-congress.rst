Why congress
============

IT services will always be governed and brought into compliance with
business-level policies.

In the past, policy was enforced manually, e.g. by someone sending an email
asking for an application to be added to the network, secured by specific
firewall entries, connected to an agreed-on storage, and so on. In the cloud
era, IT has become more agile: users expect immediate delivery of services,
a level of responsiveness that is unattainable by the team responsible for
governance. Hence, manual enforcement is no longer feasible.

Both enterprises and vendors have fielded engines for enforcing policy
(semi)-automatically, creating a fragmented market where enterprises reinvent
the wheel while maintaining their own code, and vendors fail to meet enterprise
needs, either for technical reasons or because their solutions require vertical
integration and lock-in.

The Congress policy service enables IT services to extend their OpenStack
footprint by onboarding new applications while keeping the strong compliance
and governance dictated by their own business policies. All of that leveraging
a community-driven implementation in which vendors can plug into a common
interface.
